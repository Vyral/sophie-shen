There's some great news for buyers in our market right now—The average mortgage rate has been dropping the past few months, and it’s almost 1% lower than it was during the winter of 2018. The sound of that might make you ready to shop for a home, but before you do, remember to get pre-approved first.

In fact, there are several ways a pre-approval letter will benefit you as a buyer.&nbsp;

First of all, **it helps you better understand what your monthly mortgage payment will be.**

Secondly, **it gives you a good evaluation from a lender’s perspective.**&nbsp;

Lastly, **it gives sellers more confidence in your offer.** Recently, we listed a home that fielded multiple offers, and the one that ended up winning had a smaller down payment compared to the others, but the buyer had a strong pre-approval letter and could show that they could close quickly and without issue. In that way, a good pre-approval letter helps both the buyer and the seller.&nbsp;

If you want to get pre-approved, give us a call and we’d be happy to connect you with a good lender.
